Think of them as **states of crowd psychology**, not just price movement.

## 🔹 1. **FALLING**

### What it means

The market is in a **downtrend** — sellers are in control.

### What you usually see

* Lower highs and lower lows
* Rallies get sold quickly
* Momentum is negative
* Buyers are defensive or absent

### Psychology

> “I want out. Rallies are selling opportunities.”

### Typical behavior

* Institutions are **distributing earlier inventory**
* Weak hands are exiting
* Trend followers are short

---

## 🔹 2. **RISING**

### What it means

The market is in an **uptrend** — buyers dominate.

### What you see

* Higher highs and higher lows
* Pullbacks are shallow
* Price holds above support

### Psychology

> “Buy the dip. This thing keeps going.”

### Typical behavior

* Institutions accumulating earlier are now pushing price
* Momentum traders pile in
* Breakouts work

---

## 🔹 3. **ACCUMULATING**

### What it means

The market is **absorbing supply quietly**.

Price moves sideways, but smart money is building positions.

### What you see

* Tight range
* Low volatility
* False breakdowns / fake breakouts

### Psychology

> “Nothing is happening” (but something *is* happening)

This is where strong moves are born.

---

## 🔹 4. **SELLING** (Distribution)

### What it means

The market is **distributing inventory** after a run-up.

### What you see

* Volatile swings
* Failed breakouts
* Heavy volume near highs
* No real progress upward

### Psychology

> “Smart money exits, public buys the top”

This often precedes sharp drops.

## 🧠 How These Fit Together (Lifecycle)

```
ACCUMULATION → RISING → SELLING → FALLING → (repeat)
```

This cycle repeats on **every timeframe**.

## 🔍 Why Your Classifier Uses These

You’re not trying to predict the future.
You’re answering:

> “What kind of environment am I trading in *right now*?”

That’s why these four states are enough — they capture **intent**, not noise.
